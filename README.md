### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mika.

I am a student and teaching assistant at the [IT University of
Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk). 

My primary interest within the field of computer science lies in the realm of
artificial intelligence. I strive to understand cutting-edge research in
mathematical and technical detail by reading papers, implementing theoretical
concepts in code, building exciting products, and educating others.

Much of the above is connected to [AITU](https://aitu.group), a student
organisation that I have cofounded. We maintain a
[blog](https://aitu.group/blog), in which we summarise the main ideas of papers
that we have read, as well as reflect on events we hosted and competitions we
participated in.

### ðŸ¤— Connect with me

I am always interested in exciting projects, research, or startup ideas. Reach
out to me for collaboration of any kind. I am looking forward to hearing about your
vision. Catch me all day, every day via [mail](mailto:mail@mikasenghaas.de) or
on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/mikasenghaas).
